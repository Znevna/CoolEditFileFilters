Cool Edit File Filters
----------------------
Various file filters for the ancient, but still excellent, Cool Edit 2000 application.
They may also work with very early versions of Adobe Audition.

The latest release can be found at https://github.com/jfchapman/CoolEditFileFilters/releases/latest

The following file filters are included:
- flac.flt - Free Lossless Audio Codec (read/write)
- opus.flt - Opus Audio Codec (read/write)
- ffmpeg.flt - FFmpeg (read only)
- openmpt.flt - Tracker formats (MOD, XM, IT, etc.) via libopenmpt (read only)

The FFmpeg filter should read just about any audio/video file format.
For video files, the default audio track will be read.
